Hello!

In this tutorial I want to teach you how to build projects using
*object-oriented programming* (OOP). We'll do this by building a small blackjack
game that you can play in your terminal.

**main.js**

This file will run our game if we enter this in the terminal:
```
node main.js
```
All this file does is instantiate a `Blackjack` object, and then call `start_game`.

**Blackjack.js**

In OOP we break down our program into objects. I often start with just one
object and one method. In this case we have just the `Blackjack` object and the
`start_game` method. As the program becomes more complex we will break it down
into smaller objects and methods later. How to do that will be the focus of this
tutorial.


#### Follow Along
Next we need to complete the `start_game` method. Try describing what you think
needs to happen when this method is called.
