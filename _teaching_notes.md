**Blackjack.js**

I think this last part is straightforward. We reset the bet amount, empty both
player and dealer's hand, and create a new shuffled deck of cards. Finally we
add the `cleanup` method to the loop in `startGame`.

#### Final Thoughts
Congratulations if you made it to the end! There's still many things that could
be worked on in this project. I've listed some of them out in the
[issues of this project's github page](https://github.com/allenkim67/blackjack-js).
This includes things like:

1. validating user input
2. new features: double down, split, insurance
3. multiple players

Feel free to make a fork and work through these extra challenges. You can even
make a pull request so other's can see and comment on your work.
